## Welcome to the multiverse

Greetings traveler, I see that you have found my profile.

If you are lost, head over to the **[Mage Portal][0]** and it will see you to your destination.

### Work it harder, make it better...

The assembler dwarves are currently working on **[Reinforcing the Quantum Vault][1]** in order to later upgrade its [visuals][2] and [computation][3] modules.

If there is no quantum leakage, they might even start this [physics][4] module they've been thinking about for so long.


In a parallel universe, elves are catching up and getting ready for this year's **[Advent of Code][5]**
