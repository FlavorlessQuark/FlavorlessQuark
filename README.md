Don't know where to go from here?

Go over to the **[Mage_Portal][1]** 

for a list of all my fantastic projects and where to find them.

# Heart of the Code

My code is separated in 4 categories:

- **[Repositories][2]** | Here are mostly tools, coding problems /contests and everything of the likes

- **[Sigma][3]** | There lives most of the bigger projects such a rendering engines, simulations and anything involving triangles

- **[Compute-Progress][4]** | Sandbox projects and small games to asses current skill and try new things

- **[42Curriculum][5]** | Projects I complete during my time in 42 SiliconValley / 42Paris


## Current Projects
