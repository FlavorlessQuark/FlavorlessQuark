# May the Code be with you, Always.

*I have mostly been programming in* **[C][6]** *and Python and some C++ here and there.*

**[Mage Portal][0]** for an overview and brief description of what I have been working on 

All of the repos on the repository tab are mostly Misc | General projects , such a librairies or coding problems. For actual projects see :

- **[Compute Progress][8]**: Mostly small games and graphics based projects.A little bit of a sandbox in that regard.

- **[Sigma][10]**: Intended for those more"serious" projects. Maybe some ML in the future...

- **[42 projects][9]**: Projects I completed during my time at 42.
