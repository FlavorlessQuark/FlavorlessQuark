# May the Code be with you, Always.

Greetings traveler, I see that you have found my profile.

## __About:__

*I have mostly been programming in* **[C][6]** *with a little bit of Python and C++ here and there.*

*If you want to know more about things I think while coding or what I'm currently doing, you are welcome to look at the* **[Task_Manager][4]** *or peer through the* **[Black_Hole][7]**
<br> <img align="right" src="smallportal.gif"/><br>
If you are lost, head through to the **[Mage Portal][0]** for an overview and brief description of what I have been working on 

All of the repos on the repository tab are mostly Misc | General projects , such a librairies or coding problems.For actual projects see :

- **[Games and dragons][8]**: Mostly small games and graphics based projects.A little bit of a sandbox in that regard

- **[Sigma][10]**: Intended for those more"serious" projects. Maybe some ML in the future...

- **[42 projects][9]**: Projects I completed during my time at 42.
