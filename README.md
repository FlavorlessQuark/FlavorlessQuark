# How well, not How much

## Don't get lost~


Don't know where to go from here? Go over to the **[Mage_Portal][1]** for a list of all my fantastic projects and where to find them;

# Heart of the Code

- **[Repositories][2]**     | Here are mostly tools, coding problems / contests and everything of the likes;

- **[Sigma][3]**            | There lives most of the bigger projects such as rendering engines, simulations and anything involving triangles;

- **[Compute-Progress][4]** | Sandbox projects and small games to assess current skill and try new things;
 
- **[42Curriculum][5]**     | Projects I completed during my time in 42 SiliconValley / 42Paris;
